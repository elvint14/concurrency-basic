Creating Threads with the ExecutorService.
You first obtain an instance of an ExecutorService interface,
and then you send the service tasks to be processed. The framework
includes numerous useful features, such as thread pooling and scheduling,
which would be cumbersome for you to implement in every project.
Therefore, it is recommended that you use this framework anytime
you need to create and execute a separate task, even if you need only a single thread.
