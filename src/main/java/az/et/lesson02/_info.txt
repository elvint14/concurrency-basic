Callable for short, which is similar to Runnable except that its call() method
returns a value and can throw a checked exception. From the definition of Runnable,
the run() method returns void and cannot throw any checked exceptions.
The Callable interface was introduced as an alternative to the Runnable interface,
since it allows more details to be retrieved easily from the task after it is completed.
The ExecutorService includes an overloaded version of the "submit()" method that takes a
Callable object and returns a generic Future<T> object.
