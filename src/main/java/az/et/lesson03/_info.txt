The difference between a single-thread and a pooled-thread executor is what happens
when a task is already running. While a single-thread executor will wait for an available
thread to become available before running the next task, a pooled-thread executor can
execute the next task concurrently. If the pool runs out of available threads, the task will be
queued by the thread executor and wait to be completed.
